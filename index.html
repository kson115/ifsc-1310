      <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
       <h3>1. What web accessibility means to me</h3>
        <p>Learning to create a HTML document seems not an easy task. It appears to me that 
        learning another foreign language, CSS, to make a better-looking webpage sounds unnecessary 
        and wasting time. How about learning the third one, JavaScript, for behavior? As long as 
        I get what I want to find from any webpages, that is <strong>content</strong>, what matters so much about 
        different ways of being <strong>designed, presented and behaved</strong>? Then how about a webpage that 
        everyone, I mean <strong>all</strong>, no matter what physical and mental problems they might have, 
        can easily access, search, navigate, read, understand and respond? That’s a different story. 
        Considering me without any disabilities, I have often experienced difficulties in accessing some of websites 
        I wanted to visit. Here is a simple quote that attracts my attention: 
        <cite>“Everyone should be able to enjoy your websites, regardless of ability”</cite>(<a href="https://accessibe.com/" target="_blank">accessibe</a>)
        </p>

      <h3>2. Why it is important to build accessible web sites</h3>
       <p>It was impressive to hear from <cite>Derek Featherstone</cite> in his vedio who pointed out that
      accessibility for the Modern Web technologies such as keyboard-accessible controls, voice recognition software, and ARIA
      (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) benefit people with disabilities who need access to the government and state websites like everyone else:<blockquote> “...people that are visually impaired, 
      that use screen readers, that use keyboards, people with fine motor control issues 
      that… struggle with using a mouse.”</blockquote> 
      Obviously it worths spending time and money on developing and designing those technologies. 
      The following resources among many others provide more information about how to build accessible websites:

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Which technology is better for designing websites,  graceful degradation or progressive enhancement? Aaron Gustafson addressed this issue in his article "Understanding Progressive Enhancement," published, on October 7, 2008. According to him,  there were major differences between the two approaches.</p>
      <p>What was understood is that graceful degradation starts with the most updated and advanced browsers. After that, developers try to scale back for older browsers to check how it works in them, which is still usable without the user’s full experience.  This can make the workflow more complicated and less user-friendly.</p>      
      <p>In contrast, progressive enhancement starts with the basics, HTML, and then adds more advanced features/enhancements like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity in layers. He compared designing a website with progressive enhancement to an M&M candy, where the chocolate candy core represents the content and functionality, and the candy shell the added enhancements. Just as an M&M candy remains tasty and enjoyable even if the shell is missing or not supported, a progressively enhanced website remains usable and accessible with the user's old browser. I think Aaron Gustafson's M&M analogy is quite convincing. The analogy makes it easier for me to understand a complex technical concept. This technology makes websites (the content) accessible to all users. In addition, their workflow can be simpler, more approachable, and easily maintained and updated. Now I know that the lectures we were given throughout this semester used this progressive enhancement technology.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, he did not offer an analogy to graceful degradation. Since the two approaches are opposite, I can easily imagine an M&M inside out: candy in the core, chocolate in the middle, and peanut outside coating around the chocolate. The taste should not be changed as all three ingredients are there. However,  just as this inside-out M&M changes its taste if the peanut in the shell is missing or damaged, a graceful degradation website has no content and becomes unusable and inaccessible. Therefore, progressive enhancement technology is a better choice than graceful degradation.</p>

      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>Although help was provided, the final project was more challenging than the HTML and CSS-Demo lectures. This was expected, but simply listening to the lecture and copying the code was not as creative or engaging as designing the project myself. Working through each lecture did not give me the impression that HTML and CSS language were hard to learn. Rather it was fun to code and see how a webpage progressively changed to look more appealing.

      <p>However, I had trouble figuring out the difference in building Flexbox for three articles between the CSS-Demo and the final project. I struggled with the title of three articles: “Configuration” introduced in the final project. While the CSS-Demo used a max-width of 100% and didn’t require adjusting with the Flexbox width, the final project did. In addition, I missed the image dimensions specified in the CSS-Demo, resulting in spending some time manipulating/resizing them. Properly marking up the content is crucial for the next step of styling which relies on the right selectors to enhance HTML content.</p> 
        
      <p>Lots of materials were covered with rich resources over 14 weeks. How can I remember and use them to code independently, even a simple webpage all alone?  How much will I be able to understand websites built by others, which seem very complicated and overwhelming when using “Inspect” or  “Developer Tools”? Feedback given was also challenging and it was interesting to learn that there were different but confusing ways to code for the same goal. This is my first step forward, and it seems like there is no end, and a long way to go.</p>
        
      <p>I have enjoyed watching and listening to your video lectures and learning how to build web pages this semester.  With earbuds in I could focus on them multiple times without environmental distractions which greatly facilitated learning experiences.</p>
