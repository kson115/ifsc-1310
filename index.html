      <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
       <h4>1. What web accessibility means to me</h4>
        <p>Learning to create a HTML document seems not an easy task. It appears to me that 
        learning another foreign language, CSS, to make a better-looking webpage sounds unnecessary 
        and wasting time. How about learning the third one, JavaScript, for behavior? As long as 
        I get what I want to find from any webpages, that is <strong>content</strong>, what matters so much about 
        different ways of being <strong>designed, presented and behaved</strong>? Then how about a webpage that 
        everyone, I mean <strong>all</strong>, no matter what physical and mental problems they might have, 
        can easily access, search, navigate, read, understand and respond? That’s a different story. 
        Considering me without any disabilities, I have often experienced difficulties in accessing some of websites 
        I wanted to visit. Here is a simple quote that attracts my attention: 
        <cite>“Everyone should be able to enjoy your websites, regardless of ability”</cite>(<a href="https://accessibe.com/" target="_blank">accessibe</a>)
        </p>

      <h4>2. Why it is important to build accessible web sites</h4>
       <p>It was impressive to hear from <cite>Derek Featherstone</cite> in his vedio who pointed out that
      accessibility for the Modern Web technologies such as keyboard-accessible controls, voice recognition software, and ARIA
      (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) benefit people with disabilities who need access to the government and state websites like everyone else:<blockquote> “...people that are visually impaired, 
      that use screen readers, that use keyboards, people with fine motor control issues 
      that… struggle with using a mouse.”</blockquote> 
      Obviously it worths spending time and money on developing and designing those technologies. 
      The following resources among many others provide more information about how to build accessible websites:
