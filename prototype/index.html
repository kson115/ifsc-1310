    <p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. 
   It is characterized by <em>student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, 
   academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests.</em> Some of the services offered by 
   the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, 
   leadership development, peer tutoring, student government association, student support programs including 
   groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. 
   The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of 
   a wide array of recreational, entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not 
   available anywhere else in Arkansas.<sup><a href="#bottom">20</a></sup></p>

    <h3><a href="https://ualr.edu/housing" target="_blank">Campus living</a></h3>
     <p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms 
  to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and 
  the University Village Apartment Complex<sup><a href="#bottom">21</a></sup> on the southern side of campus. 
  Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, 
  nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://lrtrojans.com" target="_blank">Athletics</a></h3>
    <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as <em>the Little Rock Trojans</em>, with almost all teams participating 
   in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); 
   UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. <em>Little Rock's main athletic offices 
   are located in the Jack Stephens Center.</em></p>
